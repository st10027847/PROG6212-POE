**HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM**

In order to use the program, there are a few pre-requisites:

1. You must have the full project[1] folder in one location/path,
2. You must have the SQL script which will be run from **MySQL Workbench 8.0**,
3. You need to have the correct database name, username, and password to access your server (MySQL Workbench)


**NOTE: PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THE PROJECT FOLDERS, WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:**
**1. bin folder**
**2. obj folder**
**3. packages folder**
**4. Properties folder**
**5. App.config**
**6. App.xaml**
**7. App.xaml**
**8. MainWindow.xaml**
**9. MainWindow.xaml**
**10. packages.config**
**11. PROG6212-POE.csproj**
**12. PROG6212-POE.sln**

**There is another folder which will be used as a custom class library, called PROG6212-CustomClassLibrary. The folders are listed as follows:**

**1. bin folder**
**2. obj folder**
**3. Properties**
**4. Module.cs file**
**5. PROG6212-CustomClassLib.csproj file**

You will need to access the SQL script in MySQL Workbench and the C# project in Microsoft Visual Studio (Recommended), and you will need to have access to the **PROG6212-CustomClassLib**

When running the program, ensure that the main project (PROG6212-POE) has the PROG6212-CustomClassLibrary project as a dependency.

**NOTE: BOTH THE FOLDERS - PROG6212-POE AND PROG6212-CustomClassLibrary - MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY (EXAMPLE: C:/users/[your account]/source/repos/[folder/file name]) AS THIS WILL BE NECESSARY WHEN OPENING THE PROJECTS.**
